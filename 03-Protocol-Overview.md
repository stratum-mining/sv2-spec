# 3. Protocol Overview

There are technically three distinct (sub)protocols needed in order to fully use all of the features proposed in this document:

1. **Mining Protocol**  
   The main protocol used for mining and the direct successor of Stratum v1.
   A mining device uses it to communicate with its upstream node, pool, or a proxy.
   A proxy uses it to communicate with a pool (or another proxy).
   This protocol needs to be implemented in all scenarios.
   For cases in which a miner or pool does not support transaction selection, this is the only protocol used.

2. **Job Declaration Protocol**  
   Used by a miner (a whole mining farm) to declare a block template with a pool.
   Results of this declaration can be re-used for all mining connections to the pool to reduce computational intensity.
   In other words, a single declaration can be used by an entire mining farm or even multiple farms with hundreds of thousands of devices, making it far more efficient.
   This is separate to allow pools to terminate such connections on separate infrastructure from mining protocol connections (i.e. share submissions).
   Further, such connections have very different concerns from share submissions - work declaration likely requires, at a minimum, some spot-checking of work validity, as well as potentially substantial rate-limiting (without the inherent rate-limiting of share difficulty).

3. **Template Distribution Protocol**  
   A similarly-framed protocol for getting information about the next block out of Bitcoin Core.
   Designed to replace `getblocktemplate` with something much more efficient and easy to implement for those implementing other parts of Stratum v2.

Meanwhile, there are five possible roles (types of software/hardware) for communicating with these protocols.

1. **Mining Device**  
   The actual device computing the hashes. This can be further divided into header-only mining devices and standard mining devices, though most devices will likely support both modes.

2. **Pool Service**  
   Produces jobs (for those not declaring jobs via the Job Declaration Protocol), validates shares, and ensures blocks found by clients are propagated through the network (though clients which have full block templates MUST also propagate blocks into the Bitcoin P2P network).

3. **Mining Proxy (optional)**  
   Sits in between Mining Device(s) and Pool Service, aggregating connections for efficiency.
   May optionally provide additional monitoring, receive work from a Job Declarator and use custom work with a pool, or provide other services for a farm.

4. **Job Declarator (optional)**  
   It is further divided into a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server.
   The Job Declarator Client receives custom block templates from a Template Provider and declares use of them with the Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side) using the Job Declaration Protocol.

5. **Template Provider**  
   Generates custom block templates to be passed to the Job Declarator for eventual mining.
   This is usually just a Bitcoin Core full node (or possibly some other node implementation).

The Mining Protocol is used for communication between a Mining Device and Pool Service, Mining Device and Mining Proxy, Mining Proxy and Mining Proxy, or Mining Proxy and Pool Service.

The Job Declaration Protocol is used for communication between a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side).

The Template Distribution Protocol is used for communication either between a Job Declarator Client and a Template Provider or between a Pool Service and Template Provider.


One type of software/hardware can fulfill more than one role (e.g. a Mining Proxy is often both a Mining Proxy and a Job Declarator and may occasionally further contain a Template Provider in the form of a full node on the same device).

Each sub-protocol is based on the same technical principles and requires a connection oriented transport layer, such as TCP.
In specific use cases, it may make sense to operate the protocol over a connectionless transport with FEC or local broadcast with retransmission.
However, that is outside of the scope of this document.
The minimum requirement of the transport layer is to guarantee ordered delivery of the protocol messages.

## 3.1 Data Types Mapping

Message definitions use common data types described here for convenience.
Multibyte data types are always serialized as little-endian.


| Data Type | Byte Length                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Encoded as an unsigned 1-bit integer, True = 1, False = 0 with 7 additional padding bits in the high positions. Recipients MUST NOT interpret bits outside of the least significant bit. Senders MAY set bits outside of the least significant bit to any value without any impact on meaning. This allows future use of other bits as flag bits. |

## 3.2 Framing

The protocol is binary, with fixed message framing.
Each message begins with the extension type, message type, and message length (six bytes in total), followed by a variable length message.
The message framing is outlined below:

| Field Name  | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 3.2.1 Routing Frames over Channels

Some bits of the `extension_type` field can also be repurposed for signaling on how the frame should be handled across channels.

The least significant bit of `extension_type` (i.e., bit 15, 0-indexed, also known as `channel_msg`) indicates a message which is specific to a channel, whereas if the most significant bit is unset, the message is to be interpreted by the immediate receiving device. 

Note that the `channel_msg` bit is ignored in the extension lookup, i.e., an `extension_type` of `0x8ABC` is for the same "extension" as `0x0ABC`. 

If the `channel_msg` bit is set, the first four bytes of the payload field is a `U32` representing the `channel_id` this message is destined for (these bytes are repeated in the message framing descriptions below).

Note that for the Job Declaration and Template Distribution Protocols the `channel_msg` bit is always unset.

## 3.3 Reconnecting Downstream Nodes

An upstream stratum node may occasionally request reconnection of its downstream peers to a different host (e.g. due to maintenance reasons, etc.).
This request is per upstream connection and affects all open channels towards the upstream stratum node.

After receiving a request to reconnect, the downstream node MUST run the handshake protocol with the new node as long as its previous connection was also running through a secure cryptographic session state.

## 3.4 Protocol Extensions

Protocol extensions may be defined by using a non-0 `extension_type` field in the message header (not including the `channel_msg` bit).
The value used MUST either be in the range `0x4000` - `0x7fff` (inclusive, i.e. have the second-to-most-significant-bit set) denoting an "experimental" extension and not be present in production equipment, or have been allocated for the purpose at [http://stratumprotocol.org](http://stratumprotocol.org).
While extensions SHOULD have BIPs written describing their full functionality, `extension_type` allocations MAY also be requested for vendor-specific proprietary extensions to be used in production hardware.
This is done by sending an email with a brief description of the intended use case to the Bitcoin Protocol Development List and extensions@stratumprotocol.org.
(Note that these contacts may change in the future, please check the latest version of this BIP prior to sending such a request.)

Extensions are left largely undefined in this BIP, however, there are some basic requirements that all extensions must comply with/be aware of.
For unknown `extension_type`'s, the `channel_msg` bit in the `extension_type` field determines which device the message is intended to be processed on: if set, the channel endpoint (i.e. either an end mining device, or a pool server) is the final recipient of the message, whereas if unset, the final recipient is the endpoint of the connection on which the message is sent.
Note that in cases where channels are aggregated across multiple devices, the proxy which is aggregating multiple devices into one channel forms the channel’s "endpoint" and processes channel messages.
Thus, any proxy devices which receive a message with the `channel_msg` bit set and an unknown `extension_type` value MUST forward that message to the downstream/upstream device which corresponds with the `channel_id` specified in the first four bytes of the message payload.
Any `channel_id` mapping/conversion required for other channel messages MUST be done on the `channel_id` in the first four bytes of the message payload, but the message MUST NOT be otherwise modified.
If a device is aware of the semantics of a given extension type, it MUST process messages for that extension in accordance with the specification for that extension.

Messages with an unknown `extension_type` which are to be processed locally (as defined above) MUST be discarded and ignored.

### 3.4.1 Implementing Extensions Support

To support extensions, an implementation MUST first implement [Extension 1](./extensions/extensions-negotiation.md), which defines the basic protocol for requesting and negotiating support for extensions. This extension must be included in any protocol implementation that plans to support additional protocol extensions.

Extensions MUST require negotiation with the recipient of the message to check that the extension is supported before sending non-version-negotiation messages for it.
This prevents the needlessly wasted bandwidth and potentially serious performance degradation of extension messages when the recipient does not support them.

See `ChannelEndpointChanged` message in Common Protocol Messages for details about how extensions interact with dynamic channel reconfiguration in proxies.

## 3.4.1 Stratum V2 TLV Encoding Model

To ensure a consistent and extensible way of adding optional fields to existing messages, **Stratum V2 supports Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding** for protocol extensions. This model allows for structured, backward-compatible extensions while ensuring that unknown fields can be safely ignored.

### TLV Structure

Each TLV-encoded field follows this format:

| **Field**  | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Type**   | 3 bytes (U16 + U8) | Identifies the TLV field. The first 2 bytes represent the `extension_type`, and the third byte represents the `field_type` within the extension context. |
| **Length** | 2 bytes (U16) | Indicates the size (in bytes) of the Value field. |
| **Value**  | `N` bytes  | The actual data of the extension field, of variable length. |

- The **Type** field consists of **3 bytes**, where:
   - The **first 2 bytes** (`U16`) correspond to the negotiated `extension_type`, ensuring modular and self-contained extensions.
   - The **third byte** (`U8`) specifies the `field_type` defined in the extension, allowing multiple fields to be added within the same message.
- The **Length** field defines the exact size of the **Value**, allowing efficient message parsing.
- If the **Length** is `0x0000`, the **Value** field is omitted.
- When multiple fields extend the same message type, their order **MUST** match the order defined in the extension.

### Usage Guidelines

- **TLV fields MUST be placed at the end of the message payload.** This ensures compatibility with existing Stratum V2 messages.
- **TLV fields MUST be ordered by `extension_type`.** Since all extensions are negotiated beforehand, the recipient MUST process TLV fields in order of `extension_type` and use their `Type` identifiers to correctly interpret them.
- **Order of TLV fields within the same extension MUST be respected.** If an extension defines multiple TLV fields to extend a single message, they **MUST** appear in the exact order specified by the extension’s documentation.
- **Length constraints MUST be respected.** Each extension must specify the valid length range for its TLV fields. If a TLV field exceeds the maximum length allowed by its specification, the recipient MUST reject the message.

### Example: Extending `SubmitSharesExtended`

If extension **0x0002** (Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking) is negotiated, clients must append the following TLV field to `SubmitSharesExtended`:
```
[TYPE: 0x0002 0x01] [LENGTH: 0x000A] [VALUE: "Worker_001"]
```
Encoded as:
```
00 02 01 00 0A 57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31
```

Where:
- `00 02 01` → TLV Type (Extension `0x0002`, Field `0x01` — `user_identity`)
- `00 0A` → Length = 10 bytes
- `57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31` → `"Worker_001"` (UTF-8 encoded)

A device processing `SubmitSharesExtended` **MUST scan for TLV fields** matching any negotiated extensions, allowing for future extensibility without breaking compatibility.


## 3.5 Error Codes

The protocol uses string error codes.
The list of error codes can differ between implementations, and thus implementations MUST NOT take any automated action(s) on the basis of an error code.
Implementations/pools SHOULD provide documentation on the meaning of error codes and error codes SHOULD use printable ASCII where possible.
Furthermore, error codes MUST NOT include control characters.

To make interoperability simpler, the following error codes are provided which implementations SHOULD consider using for the given scenarios.
Individual error codes are also specified along with their respective error messages.

- `unknown-user`
- `too-low-difficulty`
- `stale-share`
- `unsupported-feature-flags`
- `unsupported-protocol`
- `protocol-version-mismatch`

## 3.6 Common Protocol Messages

The following protocol messages are common across all of the protocols described in this BIP.

### 3.6.1 `SetupConnection` (Client -> Server)

Initiates the connection.
This MUST be the first message sent by the client on the newly opened connection.
Server MUST respond with either a `SetupConnection.Success` or `SetupConnection.Error` message.
Clients that are not configured to provide telemetry data to the upstream node SHOULD set `device_id` to 0-length strings.
However, they MUST always set vendor to a string describing the manufacturer/developer and firmware version and SHOULD always set `hardware_version` to a string describing, at least, the particular hardware/software package in use.

### 3.6.2 `SetupConnection.Success` (Server -> Client)

Response to `SetupConnection` message if the server accepts the connection.
The client is required to verify the set of feature flags that the server supports and act accordingly.

| Field Name   | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| used_version | U16       | Selected version proposed by the connecting node that the upstream node supports. This version will be used on the connection for the rest of its life. |
| flags        | U32       | Flags indicating optional protocol features the server supports. Each protocol from protocol field has its own values/flags.                            |

### 3.6.3 `SetupConnection.Error` (Server -> Client)

When protocol version negotiation fails (or there is another reason why the upstream node cannot setup the connection) the server sends this message with a particular error code prior to closing the connection.

In order to allow a client to determine the set of available features for a given server (e.g. for proxies which dynamically switch between different pools and need to be aware of supported options), clients SHOULD send a SetupConnection message with all flags set and examine the (potentially) resulting `SetupConnection.Error` message’s flags field.
The Server MUST provide the full set of flags which it does not support in each `SetupConnection.Error` message and MUST consistently support the same set of flags across all servers on the same hostname and port number.
If flags is 0, the error is a result of some condition aside from unsupported flags.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| flags      | U32       | Flags indicating features causing an error                  |
| error_code | STR0_255  | Human-readable error code(s), see Error Codes section below |

Possible error codes:

- `unsupported-feature-flags`
- `unsupported-protocol`
- `protocol-version-mismatch`

### 3.6.4 `ChannelEndpointChanged` (Server -> Client)

When a channel’s upstream or downstream endpoint changes and that channel had previously sent messages with **`channel_msg`** bitset of unknown `extension_type`, the intermediate proxy MUST send a **`ChannelEndpointChanged`** message.
Upon receipt thereof, any extension state (including version negotiation and the presence of support for a given extension) MUST be reset and version/presence negotiation must begin again.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| channel_id | U32       | The channel which has changed enpoint |

### 3.6.5 `Reconnect` (Server -> Client)

This message allows clients to be redirected to a new upstream node.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new_host   | STR0_255  | When empty, downstream node attempts to reconnect to its present host |
| new_port   | U16       | When 0, downstream node attempts to reconnect to its present port     |

This message is connection-related so that it should not be propagated downstream by intermediate proxies.
Upon receiving the message, the client re-initiates the Noise handshake and uses the pool’s authority public key to verify that the certificate presented by the new server has a valid signature.

For security reasons, it is not possible to reconnect to a server with a certificate signed by a different pool authority key.
The message intentionally does not contain a **pool public key** and thus cannot be used to reconnect to a different pool.
This ensures that an attacker will not be able to redirect hashrate to an arbitrary server should the pool server get compromised and instructed to send reconnects to a new location.

## 3.7 BIP141

[BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) introduced the notion of Segregated Witness (SegWit) into the Bitcoin protocol.

This deserves some consideration in the Stratum V2 protocol design, mainly because this affects how the Coinbase transaction is serialized across different messages.

On a serialized SegWit transaction, the BIP141 fields are:
- marker
- flag
- witness count
- witness length
- witness

The presence or absence of these fields on a serialized Coinbase has important implications on the Stratum V2 protocol. More specifically, the following messages are affected:
- `NewExtendedMiningJob` of Mining Protocol
- `DeclareMiningJob` of Job Declaration Protocol
- `SubmitSolution` of Template Distribution Protocol

### 3.7.1 BIP141 on `NewExtendedMiningJob`

On the Mining Protocol's `NewExtendedMiningJob` there are two fields affected by BIP141:
- `coinbase_tx_prefix`
- `coinbase_tx_suffix`

When concatenated with `extranonce_prefix` + `extranonce`, these fields form a serialized Coinbase transaction that is then hashed to produce a `txid`. Together with `merkle_path`, this `txid`
will then form the `merkle_root` of the Block Header.

In case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST be stripped away from `coinbase_tx_prefix` and `coinbase_tx_suffix`, otherwise clients would be calculating a `merkle_root` with the Coinbase's `wtxid`, which goes against Bitcoin Consensus.

The server MUST retain the original value of those fields so that it can reconstruct the Coinbase as a SegWit transaction whenever it needs to propagate a block.

### 3.7.2 BIP141 on `DeclareMiningJob`

On the Job Declaration Protocol's `DeclareMiningJob` there are two fields affected by BIP141:
- `coinbase_tx_prefix`
- `coinbase_tx_suffix`

Differently from `NewExtendedMiningJob`, in case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST NOT be stripped from `DeclareMiningJob`'s `coinbase_tx_prefix` and `coinbase_tx_suffix`.

That's because JDS needs to be able to reconstruct the Coinbase as a SegWit transaction whenever it needs to propagate a block.

### 3.7.3 BIP141 on `SubmitSolution`

On the Template Distribution Protocol's `SubmitSolution` there is one field affected by BIP141:
- `coinbase_tx`

Differently from `NewExtendedMiningJob`, in case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST NOT be stripped from `SubmitSolution`'s `coinbase_tx`.

That's because the Template Distribution Server would not be able to propagate a block without that data.
