# 7. Template Distribution Protocol

The Template Distribution protocol is used to receive updates of the block template to use in mining the next block.
It effectively replaces [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) (`getblocktemplate`) and provides a much more efficient API which allows Bitcoin Core (or some other full node software) to push template updates at more appropriate times as well as provide a template which may be mined on quickly for the block-after-next.
While not recommended, the template update protocol can be a remote server, and is thus authenticated and signed in the same way as all other protocols (using the same SetupConnection handshake).

Like the Job Declaration and Job Distribution protocols, all Template Distribution messages have the `channel_msg` bit unset, and there is no concept of channels.
After the initial common handshake, the client MUST immediately send a `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` message to indicate the space it requires for coinbase output addition, to which the server MUST immediately reply with the current best block template it has available to the client.
Thereafter, the server SHOULD push new block templates to the client whenever the total fee in the current block template increases materially, and MUST send updated block templates whenever it learns of a new block.

Template Providers MUST attempt to broadcast blocks which are mined using work they provided, and thus MUST track the work which they provided to clients.

## 7.1 `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` (Client -> Server)

Ultimately, the pool is responsible for adding coinbase transaction outputs for payouts and other uses, and thus the Template Provider will need to consider this additional block size, and sigops when selecting transactions for inclusion in a block (to not create an invalid, oversized block).
Thus, this message is used to indicate that some additional space and sigops in the block/coinbase transaction be reserved for the pool’s use (while always assuming the pool will use the entirety of available coinbase space and sigops).

The Job Declarator MUST discover the maximum serialized size of the additional outputs and sigops which will be added by the pool(s) it intends to use this work.
It then MUST communicate it to the Template Provider via this message.
The Template Provider MUST NOT provide `NewTemplate` messages which would represent consensus-invalid blocks once this additional size and sigops — along with a maximally-sized (100 byte) coinbase script field — is added.
Further, the Template Provider MUST consider the maximum additional bytes required in the output count variable-length integer in the coinbase transaction when complying with the size limits.
Current sigops limit per block in bitcoin is 80_000. We are not aware of any use cases where
coinbase have more the 65_535 so coinbase_output_max_sigops is an U16. Note that taproot outputs consume 0 sigops.

Please note that differently from `SetCustomMiningJob.coinbase_tx_outputs` and `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success.coinbase_tx_outputs`, `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs` MUST NOT be serialized as a CompactSize-prefixed array. This field must simply carry the ordered sequence of consensus‑serialized outputs, but the number of outputs MUST be inferred from `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs_count`. This is the equivalent of taking a CompactSize-prefixed array and dropping its (outer) prefix. 

Please also note that in case the block contains SegWit transactions (and optionally blocks that don't as well), `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs` MUST carry the witness commitment. The `witness reserved value` (Coinbase witness) used for calculating this witness commitment is assumed to be 32 bytes of `0x00`, as it currently holds no consensus-critical meaning. This [may change in future soft-forks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#extensible-commitment-structure).

## 7.3 `SetNewPrevHash` (Server -> Client)

Upon successful validation of a new best block, the server MUST immediately provide a `SetNewPrevHash` message.

Prior to that, the server MUST send at least one, but potentially multiple `NewTemplate` messages with `future_template` flag set. The client SHOULD keep track of all of them, and convert them into `NewMiningJob` and `NewExtendedMiningJob` messages (with empty `min_ntime`) in case it's also acting as a server under the Mining Protocol.

If a `NewMiningJob` or `NewExtendedMiningJob` message has previously been sent with an empty `min_ntime`, and it is valid work based on the `prev_hash` contained in this message, the `template_id` field SHOULD be matched to the corresponding `NewTemplate` message that generated the `NewMiningJob` or `NewExtendedMiningJob`, and a Mining Protocol `SetNewPrevHash` message SHOULD be sent indicating the client MUST begin mining on that job as soon as possible.

After that, the future templates that were being kept in memory can be discarded, leaving room for future templates relative to the next `SetNewPrevHash`.

| header_timestamp | U32       | The nTime field in the block header at which the client should start (usually current time). This is NOT the minimum valid nTime value.                                                                |
| nBits            | U32       | Block header field                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| target           | U256      | The maximum double-SHA256 hash value which would represent a valid block. Note that this may be lower than the target implied by nBits in several cases, including weak-block based block propagation. |

## 7.4 `RequestTransactionData` (Client -> Server)

A request sent by the Job Declarator to the Template Provider which requests the set of transaction data for all transactions (excluding the coinbase transaction) included in a block, as well as any additional data which may be required by the Pool to validate the work.

| Field Name  | Data Type | Description                                            |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| template_id | U64       | The template_id corresponding to a NewTemplate message |

## 7.5 `RequestTransactionData.Success` (Server->Client)

A response to `RequestTransactionData` which contains the set of full transaction data and excess data required for validation.
For practical purposes, the excess data is usually the SegWit commitment, however the Job Declarator MUST NOT parse or interpret the excess data in any way.
Note that the transaction data MUST be treated as opaque blobs and MUST include any SegWit or other data which the Pool may require to verify the transaction.
For practical purposes, the transaction data is likely the witness-encoded transaction today.
However, to ensure backward compatibility, the transaction data MAY be encoded in a way that is different from the consensus serialization of Bitcoin transactions.

Ultimately, having some method of negotiating the specific format of transactions between the Template Provider and the Pool’s Template verification node would be overly burdensome, thus the following requirements are made explicit.
The `RequestTransactionData.Success` sender MUST ensure that the data is provided in a forwards- and backwards-compatible way to ensure the end receiver of the data can interpret it, even in the face of new, consensus-optional data.
This allows significantly more flexibility on both the `RequestTransactionData.Success`-generating and -interpreting sides during upgrades, at the cost of breaking some potential optimizations which would require version negotiation to provide support for previous versions.
For practical purposes, and as a non-normative suggested implementation for Bitcoin Core, this implies that additional consensus-optional data be appended at the end of transaction data.
It will simply be ignored by versions which do not understand it.

To work around the limitation of not being able to negotiate e.g. a transaction compression scheme, the format of the opaque data in `RequestTransactionData.Success` messages MAY be changed in non-compatible ways at the time a fork activates, given sufficient time from code-release to activation (as any sane fork would have to have) and there being some in-Template Negotiation Protocol signaling of support for the new fork (e.g. for soft-forks activated using [BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)).

| Field Name       | Data Type        | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| template_id      | U64              | The template_id corresponding to a NewTemplate/RequestTransactionData message                                                        |
| excess_data      | B0_64K           | Extra data which the Pool may require to validate the work                                                                           |
| transaction_list | SEQ0_64K[B0_16M] | List of full transactions as requested by ProvideMissingTransactions, in the order they were requested in ProvideMissingTransactions |

## 7.6 `RequestTransactionData.Error` (Server->Client)

| Field Name  | Data Type | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| template_id | U64       | The template_id corresponding to a NewTemplate/RequestTransactionData message |
| error_code  | STR0_255  | Reason why no transaction data has been provided                              |

Possible error codes:

- `template-id-not-found` - used when the template being referenced is too old and no longer stored in the memory of the Template Provider
- `stale-template-id` - used when the prev_hash of the corresponding template is still in the Template Provider's memory, but it no longer points to the latest tip 

## 7.7 `SubmitSolution` (Client -> Server)

Upon finding a coinbase transaction/nonce pair which double-SHA256 hashes at or below `SetNewPrevHash::target`, the client MUST immediately send this message, and the server MUST then immediately construct the corresponding full block and attempt to propagate it to the Bitcoin network.

| version          | U32       | The version field in the block header. Bits not defined by BIP320 as additional nonce MUST be the same as they appear in the NewTemplate message, other bits may be set to any value.                                                              |

\*Differently from `NewExtendedMiningJob`, if the original coinbase is a SegWit transaction, `coinbase_tx` MUST NOT be stripped of BIP141 fields (marker, flag, witness count, witness length and witness reserved value).
