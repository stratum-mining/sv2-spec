# 4 Protocol Security

Stratum V2 employs a type of encryption scheme called AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) to address the security aspects of all communication that occurs between clients and servers.
This provides both confidentiality and integrity for the ciphertexts (i.e. encrypted data) being transferred, as well as providing integrity for associated data which is not encrypted.
Prior to opening any Stratum V2 channels for mining, clients MUST first initiate the cryptographic session state that is used to encrypt all messages sent between themselves and servers.
Thus, the cryptographic session state is independent of V2 messaging conventions.

At the same time, this specification proposes optional use of a particular handshake protocol based on the **[Noise Protocol framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)**.
The client and server establish secure communication using Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement, as described in greater detail in the Authenticated Key Agreement Handshake section below.

Using the handshake protocol to establish secured communication is **optional** on the local network (e.g. local mining devices talking to a local mining proxy).
However, it is **mandatory** for remote access to the upstream nodes, whether they be pool mining services, job declarating services or template distributors.

## 4.1 Motivation for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data

Data transferred by the mining protocol MUST not provide an adversary with information that they can use to estimate the performance of any particular miner. Any intelligence about submitted shares can be directly converted to estimations of a miner’s earnings and can be associated with a particular username. This is unacceptable privacy leakage that needs to be addressed.

## 4.2 Motivation for Using the Noise Protocol Framework

The reasons why Noise Protocol Framework has been chosen are listed below:

- The Framework provides a formalism to describe the handshake protocol that can be verified.
- A custom certificate scheme is now possible (no need to use x509 certificates).

## 4.3 Choice of cryptographic primitives

Noise encrypted session requires Elliptic Curve (EC), Hash function (`HASH()`) and cipher function that supports AEAD mode<sup>[1](#reference-1)</sup>.

This specification describes mandatory cryptographic primitives that each implementation needs to support.
These primitives are chosen so that Noise Encryption layer for Stratum V2 can be implemented using primitives already present in Bitcoin Core project at the time of writing this spec.

### 4.3.1 Elliptic Curve

- Bitcoin's secp256k1 curve<sup>[2](#reference-2)</sup> is used
- Schnorr signature scheme is used as described in BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>

#### 4.3.1.1 EC point encoding remarks

Secp256k1 curve points, i.e. Public Keys, are points with of X- and Y-coordinate.
We serialize them in three different ways, only using the x-coordinate.

1. When signing or verifying a certificate, we use the 32 byte x-only
encoding as defined in BIP 340.<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>.

2. When sharing keys during the handshake, whether in plain text or encrypted,
we use the 64 byte ElligatorSwift x-only encoding as defined in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup> under "ElligatorSwift encoding of curve X coordinates". This encoding uses 64-bytes instead of 32-bytes in order to produce a
pseudo-random bytesteam. This is useful because the protocol handshake starts with
each side sending their public key in plain text. Additionally the use of X-only
ElligatorSwift ECDH removes the need to grind or negate private keys.

3. The Authority public key is base58-check encoded as described in 4.7.

Digital signatures are serialized in 64-bytes like in BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>.

Key generation algorithm:

1. generate random 32-byte secret key `sk`
2. let `d' = int(sk)`
3. fail if `d = 0` or `d' > n` where `n` is group order of secp256k1 curve
4. compute `P` as `d'⋅G`
5. drop the Y coordinate and compute (u, t) = XElligatorSwift(P.x)
6. ellswift_pub = bytes(u) || bytes(t)
7. output keypair `(sk, ellswift_pub)`

To perform X-only ECDH we use ellswift_ecdh_xonly(ellswift_theirs, d) as described in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup> under "Shared secret computation". The result is 32 bytes.

No assumption is made about the parity of Y-coordinate. For the purpose of signing
(e.g. certificate) and ECDH (handshake) it is _not_ necessary to "grind"
the private key. The choosen algoritms take care of this by implicitly negatating
the key, as if its public key had an even Y-coordinate.

For more information refer to BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup> and BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup>.

### 4.3.2 Hash function

- `SHA-256()` is used as a `HASH()`

### 4.3.3 Cipher function for authenticated encryption

- Cipher has methods for encryption and decryption for key `k`, nonce `n`, associated_data `ad`, plaintext `pt` and ciphertext `ct`
  - `ENCRYPT(k, n, ad, pt)`
  - `DECRYPT(k, n, ad, ct)`
- ChaCha20 and Poly1305 in AEAD mode<sup>[4](#reference-4)</sup> (ChaChaPoly) is used as a default AEAD cipher

## 4.4 Cryptographic operations

### 4.4.1 CipherState object

Object that encapsulates encryption and decryption operations with underlying AEAD mode cipher functions using 32-byte encryption key `k` and 8-byte nonce `n`.
CipherState has the following interface:

- `InitializeKey(key)`:
  - Sets `k = key`, `n = 0`
- `EncryptWithAd(ad, plaintext)`
  - If `k` is non-empty, performs `ENCRYPT(k, n++, ad, plaintext)` on the underlying cipher function, otherwise returns `plaintext`. The `++` post-increment operator applied to `n` means: "use the current n value, then increment it".
  - Where `ENCRYPT` is an evaluation of `ChaCha20-Poly1305` (IETF variant) with the passed arguments, with nonce `n` encoded as 32 zero bits, followed by a _little-endian_ 64-bit value. Note: this follows the Noise Protocol convention, rather than our normal endian.
- `DecryptWithAd(ad, ciphertext)`
  - If `k` is non-empty performs `DECRYPT(k, n++, ad, plaintext)` on the underlying cipher function, otherwise returns ciphertext. If an authentication failure occurs in `DECRYPT()` then `n` is not incremented and an error is signaled to the caller.
  - Where `DECRYPT` is an evaluation of `ChaCha20-Poly1305` (IETF variant) with the passed arguments, with nonce `n` encoded as 32 zero bits, followed by a _little-endian_ 64-bit value.

### 4.4.2 Handshake Operation

Throughout the handshake process, each side maintains these variables:

- `ck`: **chaining key**. Accumulated hash of all previous ECDH outputs. At the end of the handshake `ck` is used to derive encryption key `k`.
- `h`: **handshake hash**. Accumulated hash of _all_ handshake data that has been sent and received so far during the handshake process
- `e`, `re` **ephemeral keys**. Ephemeral key and remote party's ephemeral key, respectively.
- `s`, `rs` **static keys**. Static key and remote party's static key, respectively.

The following functions will also be referenced:

- `generateKey()`: generates and returns a fresh `secp256k1` keypair

  - Where the object returned by `generateKey` has two attributes:
    - `.public_key`, which returns an abstract object representing the public key
    - `.private_key`, which represents the private key used to generate the public key
  - Where the public_key object also has a single method:
    - `.serializeEllSwift()` that outputs a 64-byte EllSwift encoded serialization of the X-coordinate of EC point (the Y-coordinate is ignored)

- `a || b` denotes the concatenation of two byte strings `a` and `b`

- `HMAC-HASH(key, data)`

  - Applies HMAC defined in `RFC 2104`<sup>[5](#reference-5)</sup>
  - In our case where the key is always 32 bytes, this reduces down to:
    - pad the key with zero bytes to fill the hash block (block length is 64 bytes in case of SHA-256): `k' = k || <zero-bytes>`
    - calculate `temp = SHA-256((k' XOR ipad) || data)` where ipad is repeated 0x36 byte
    - output `SHA-256((k' XOR opad) || temp)` where opad is repeated 0x5c byte

- `HKDF(chaining_key, input_key_material)`: a function defined in `RFC 5869`<sup>[6](#reference-6)</sup>, evaluated with a zero-length `info` field and 2 `num_output` field:

  - Sets `temp_key = HMAC-HASH(chaining_key, input_key_material)`
  - Sets `output1 = HMAC-HASH(temp_key, byte(0x01))`
  - Sets `output2 = HMAC-HASH(temp_key, output1 || byte(0x02))`
  - Returns the pair `(output1, output2)`

- `MixKey(input_key_material)`: Executes the following steps:

  - sets `(ck, temp_k) = HKDF(ck, input_key_material, 2)`
  - calls `InitializeKey(temp_k)`

- `MixHash(data)`: Sets `h = HASH(h || data)`

- `EncryptAndHash(plaintext)`:

  - If `k` is non-empty sets `ciphertext = EncryptWithAd(h, plaintext)`, otherwise `ciphertext = plaintext`
  - Calls `MixHash(ciphertext)`
  - returns `ciphertext`

- `DecryptAndHash(ciphertext)`:

  - If `k` is non-empty sets `plaintext = DecryptWithAd(h, ciphertext)`, otherwise `plaintext = ciphertext`
  - Calls `MixHash(ciphertext)`
  - returns `plaintext`

- `ECDH(k, rk)`: performs an Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman operation
  using `k`, which is a   valid `secp256k1` private key, and `rk`, which is a EllSwift
  encoded public key
  - The output is 32 bytes
  - It is a shortcut for performing operation `v2_ecdh` defined in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup>:
    - let `k, ellswift_k` be key pair created by `ellswift_create()` function
    - let `rk` be remote public key **encoded as ellswift**.
    - let `initiator` be bool flag that is **true** if the party performing ECDH initiated the handshake
    - then `ECDH(k, rk) = v2_ecdh(k, ellswift_k, rk, initiator)`

- `v2_ecdh(k, ellswift_k, rk, initiator)`: 
  - let `ecdh_point_x32` = `ellswift_ecdh_xonly(rk, k)`
  - if initiator == true:
    - return `tagged_hash(ellswift_k, rk, ecdh_point_x32)`
    - else return `tagged_hash(rk, ellswift_k, ecdh_point_x32)`
  - **Note that the ecdh result is not commutative with respect to roles! Therefore the initiator flag is needed**

- `ellswift_ecdh_xonly` - see BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup>
- `tagged_hash(a, b, c)`:
  - let tag = `SHA256("bip324_ellswift_xonly_ecdh")`
  - return `SHA256(concatenate(tag, tag, a, b, c))`




## 4.5 Authenticated Key Agreement Handshake

The handshake chosen for the authenticated key exchange is an **`Noise_NX`** augmented by server authentication with simple 2 level public key infrastructure.

The complete authenticated key agreement (`Noise NX`) is performed in three distinct steps (acts).

1. NX-handshake part 1: `-> e`
2. NX-handshake part 2: `<- e, ee, s, es, SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`
3. Server authentication: Initiator validates authenticity of server using from `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`

Should the decryption (i.e. authentication code validation) fail at any point, the session must be terminated.

### 4.5.1 Handshake Act 1: NX-handshake part 1 `-> e`

Prior to starting first round of NX-handshake, both initiator and responder initializes handshake variables `h` (hash output), `ck` (chaining key) and `k` (encryption key):

1. **hash output** `h = HASH(protocolName)`

- Since `protocolName` more than 32 bytes in length, apply `HASH` to it.
- `protocolName` is official noise protocol name: `Noise_NX_Secp256k1+EllSwift_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`
  encoded as an ASCII string

2. **chaining key** `ck = h`
3. **hash output** `h = HASH(h)`
4. **encryption key** `k ` empty

#### 4.5.1.1 Initiator

Initiator generates ephemeral keypair and sends the public key to the responder:

1. initializes empty output buffer
2. generates ephemeral keypair `e`, appends `e.public_key.serializeEllSwift()` to the buffer (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)
3. calls `MixHash(e.public_key)`
4. calls `EncryptAndHash()` with empty payload and appends the ciphertext to the buffer (note that _k_ is empty at this point, so this effectively reduces down to `MixHash()` on empty data)
5. submits the buffer for sending to the responder in the following format

##### Ephemeral public key message:

| Field name | Description                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| PUBKEY     | Initiator's ephemeral public key |

Message length: 64 bytes

#### 4.5.1.2 Responder

1. receives ephemeral public key message (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)
2. parses received public key as `re.public_key`
3. calls `MixHash(re.public_key)`
4. calls `DecryptAndHash()` on remaining bytes (i.e. on empty data with empty _k_, thus effectively only calls `MixHash()` on empty data)

### 4.5.2 Handshake Act 2: NX-handshake part 2 `<- e, ee, s, es, SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`

Responder provides its ephemeral, encrypted static public keys and encrypted `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE` to the initiator, performs Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman operations.

##### SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE

| Field Name      | Data Type | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version         | U16       | Version of the certificate format                              |
| valid_from      | U32       | Validity start time (unix timestamp)                           |
| not_valid_after | U32       | Signature is invalid after this point in time (unix timestamp) |
| signature       | SIGNATURE | Certificate signature                                          |

Length: 74 bytes

#### 4.5.2.1 Responder

1. initializes empty output buffer
2. generates ephemeral keypair `e`, appends `e.public_key` to the buffer (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)
3. calls `MixHash(e.public_key)`
4. calls `MixKey(ECDH(e.private_key, re.public_key))`
5. appends `EncryptAndHash(s.public_key)` (64 bytes encrypted EllSwift encoded public key, 16 bytes MAC)
6. calls `MixKey(ECDH(s.private_key, re.public_key))`
7. appends `EncryptAndHash(SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE)` to the buffer
8. submits the buffer for sending to the initiator
9. return pair of CipherState objects, the first for encrypting transport messages from initiator to responder, and the second for messages in the other direction:
   1. sets `temp_k1, temp_k2 = HKDF(ck, zerolen, 2)`
   2. creates two new CipherState objects `c1` and `c2`
   3. calls `c1.InitializeKey(temp_k1)` and `c2.InitializeKey(temp_k2)`
   4. returns the pair `(c1, c2)`

##### Message format of NX-handshake part 2

Message length: 170 bytes

#### 4.5.2.2 Initiator

1. receives NX-handshake part 2 message
2. interprets first 64 bytes as EllSwift encoded `re.public_key`
3. calls `MixHash(re.public_key)`
4. calls `MixKey(ECDH(e.private_key, re.public_key))`
5. decrypts next 80 bytes with `DecryptAndHash()` and stores the results as `rs.public_key` which is **server's static public key** (note that 64 bytes is the public key and 16 bytes is MAC)
6. calls `MixKey(ECDH(e.private_key, rs.public_key)`
7. decrypts next 90 bytes with `DecryptAndHash()` and deserialize plaintext into `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE` (74 bytes data + 16 bytes MAC)
8. return pair of CipherState objects, the first for encrypting transport messages from initiator to responder, and the second for messages in the other direction:
   1. sets `temp_k1, temp_k2 = HKDF(ck, zerolen, 2)`
   2. creates two new CipherState objects `c1` and `c2`
   3. calls `c1.InitializeKey(temp_k1)` and `c2.InitializeKey(temp_k2)`
   4. returns the pair `(c1, c2)`

### 4.5.3 Server authentication

During the handshake, initiator receives `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE` and **server's static public key**. These parts make up a `CERTIFICATE` signed by an authority whose public key is generally known (for example from pool's website). Initiator confirms the identity of the server by verifying the signature in the certificate.

##### CERTIFICATE

| Field Name           | Data Type | Description                                                    | Signed field |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| version              | U16       | Version of the certificate format                              | YES          |
| valid_from           | U32       | Validity start time (unix timestamp)                           | YES          |
| not_valid_after      | U32       | Signature is invalid after this point in time (unix timestamp) | YES          |
| server_public_key    | PUBKEY    | Server's static public key that was used during NX handshake   | YES          |
| authority_public_key | PUBKEY    | Certificate authority's public key that signed this message    | NO           |
| signature            | SIGNATURE | Signature over the serialized fields marked for signing        | NO           |

This message is not sent directly. Instead, it is constructed from SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE and server's static public
key that are sent during the handshake process

The PUBKEY fields are encoded using only their 32 byte x-coordinate and _not_ with
EllSwift. For the purpose of generating and verifying the certificate, the 64 byte
EllSwift encoded server_public_key can be decoded to its 32 byte x-coordinate.

#### 4.5.3.1 Signature structure

Schnorr signature with _key prefixing_ is used<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>

signature is constructed for

- message `m`, where `m` is `HASH` of the serialized fields of the `CERTIFICATE` that are marked for signing, i.e. `m = SHA-256(version || valid_from || not_valid_after || server_public_key)`
- public key `P` that is Certificate Authority

Signature itself is concatenation of an EC point `R` and an integer `s` (note that each item is serialized as 32 bytes array) for which identity `s⋅G = R + HASH(R || P || m)⋅P` holds.

## 4.6 Encrypted stratum message framing

After handshake process is finished, both initiator and responder have CipherState objects for encryption and decryption and after initiator validated server's identity, any subsequent traffic is encrypted and decrypted with `EncryptWithAd()` and `DecryptWithAd()` methods of the respective CipherState objects with zero-length associated data.

Maximum transport message length (ciphertext) is for noise protocol message 65535 bytes.

Since Stratum Message Frame consists of
- fixed length message header: 6 bytes
- variable length serialized stratum message

Stratum Message header and stratum message payload are processed separately.

#### Encrypting stratum message
1. serialize stratum message into a plaintext binary string (payload)
2. prepare the frame header for the Stratum message `message_length` is the length of the plaintext payload.
3. encrypt and concatenate serialized header and payload:
   4. `EncryptWithAd([], header)` - 22 bytes
   5. `EncryptWithAd([], payload)` - variable length encrypted message
4. concatenate resulting header and payload ciphertext

- Note: The `message_length` (payload_length) in the encrypted Stratum message header always reflects the plaintext payload size. The size of the encrypted payload is implicitly understood to be message_length + MAC size for each block. This simplifies the decryption process and ensures clarity in interpreting frame data.

#### Decrypting stratum message
1. read exactly 22 bytes and decrypt into stratum frame or fail
2.The value `frame.message_length` should first be converted to the ciphertext length, and then that amount of data should be read and decrypted into plaintext payload. If decryption fails, the process stops
3. deserialize plaintext payload into stratum message given by `frame.extension_type` and `frame.message_type` or fail


*converting plaintext length to ciphertext length:
```c
#define MAX_CT_LEN 65535
#define MAC_LEN 16
#define MAX_PT_LEN (MAX_CT_LEN - MAC_LEN)

uint pt_len_to_ct_len(uint pt_len) {
        uint remainder;
        remainder = pt_len % MAX_PT_LEN;
        if (remainder > 0) {
                remainder += MAC_LEN;
        }
        return pt_len / MAX_PT_LEN * MAX_CT_LEN + remainder;
}
```


#### Encrypted stratum message frame layout

+--------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------+----------+------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

The `pld_length` field in the Encrypted Stratum message Header now consistently represents the plaintext length of the payload.
Serialized stratum-v2 body (payload) is split into 65519-byte chunks and encrypted to form 65535-bytes AEAD ciphertexts,
where `ct_pld_N` is the N-th ciphertext block of payload and `pt_pld_N` is the N-th plaintext block of payload.
```

## 4.7 URL Scheme and Pool Authority Key

Downstream nodes that want to use the above outlined security scheme need to have configured the **Pool Authority Public Key** of the pool that they intend to connect to. It is provided by the target pool and communicated to its users via a trusted channel.
At least, it can be published on the pool's public website.

The key can be embedded into the mining URL as part of the path.

Authority Public key is [base58-check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) encoded 32-byte secp256k1 public key (with implicit Y coordinate) prefixed with a LE u16 version prefix, currently `[1, 0]`:

| [1, 0] | 2 bytes prefix |
| ------ | -------------- |
| PUBKEY | 32 bytes authority public key |

URL example:

```

stratum2+tcp://thepool.com:34254/9bXiEd8boQVhq7WddEcERUL5tyyJVFYdU8th3HfbNXK3Yw6GRXh

```
